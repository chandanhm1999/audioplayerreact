Music player done in react!
Need repo:
## Git clone command: git clone https://github.com/chandanhm1999/audioplayerreact.git

## : Missing Dependency 'react-icons/fa':
# npm install react-icons

## Missing Dependency 'react-dom/client':
The error regarding 'react-dom/client' suggests that there might be an issue with the version of 'react-scripts'. You can try updating 'react-scripts' to the latest version:

## npm install react-scripts@latest
#### After updating 'react-scripts', restart your development server:

## npm start
Failed to load ESLint config "react-app":
This issue can occur if there's a problem with your ESLint configuration or if ESLint is not properly installed. Make sure you have ESLint installed as a devDependency:

## npm install eslint --save-dev
Additionally, ensure that your 'package.json' file has the correct ESLint configuration. You can use the following 'scripts' configuration:

json
Copy code
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint src",
  // other scripts...
}
After installing ESLint and configuring the script, run:

## npm run lint
Fix any ESLint errors reported.

After applying these changes, your project should hopefully compile without errors. If you encounter any more issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!
